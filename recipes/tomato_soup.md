# Tomato Soup

> serves 2

## Ingredients

- 2 carrots
- 2 sticks of celery
- 2 medium onions
- 2 cloves of garlic
- olive oil
- 2 organic chicken or vegetable stock cubes
- 2 x 400 g tins of quality plum tomatoes
- 6 large ripe tomatoes
- Â½ a bunch of fresh basil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

## Instructions

In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine everything except butter and flour. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.

In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until the roux is a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.

## Directions
To make the vermicelli, fill a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add dry vermicelli noodles. Let soak for 2 minutes, and drain. Rinse with cold water until noodles are cool. Separate noodles into four serving bowls and set aside while you assemble your toppings.

To build your Bun Bowls, toss your cooked and cooled
noodles with mixed greens, and then top with sliced
chicken (or vegetarian options), pickled vegetables, and
cucumber. Drizzle over with about 2-3 tbsp of N
Cham, and garnish with almonds, radish slices, mint, and a lime wedge.
